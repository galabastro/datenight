# Date Night Scheduler

## This was created for Age of Learning coding example.

## I attempted to write code in a night addressing the prompt.

### A little background on the project:

The purpose of this was to create code within a day for something that I wanted to make personally for a while while showing my expertise. My girlfriend is working a varied shift ranging from graveyard and swing shift, and even with the use of Google Calendar, I thought it would be nice to see how much time we would have for a date night, if any, and (in the future), create a Google Event inviting her to a date night.

This application takes from my Google Calendar when my work shift ends and when my girlfriend's starts. It let's me about our date night possiblity.

You'll need:
```
.env.php
client_secret.json
credentials.json (This is created via Google Auth)
```

You won't be able to run the code because I have reserved the sercret key for the API calls and information such as her email and workplace as well. I would love to demo if you invite me to your office.

Please feel free to jump through the commits to see the progress made or contact me. I would invite disscussion of code always.

## #TODO:
- ~~Update documentation for each function~~
- Allow for choosing the date rather than just for today
- Front-end component
